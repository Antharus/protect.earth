intro: Figure out how big your carbon footprint is, so you can reduce it.

Every person, company, and pet has their own carbon footprint, which is usually expressed in the number of tonnes of CO2 they've emitted over the year. These emissions are both direct (driving to the shops), or indirect (ordering something online so somebody else drives it).

Americans have some of the largest carbon footprints per person, with the average person spewing ~16.5 tonnes of CO2 into the air every year. It varies a lot by country, but the E.U. average is around 7 tonnes. If we want to stick to 2Â°C then we need to each get our footprints down to 4.8 tonnes. 2Â°C is still absolutely awful ([thousands of heat deaths in the U.S. alone](https://www.carbonbrief.org/limiting-warming-to-1-5c-could-prevent-thousands-of-heat-deaths-in-us-cities), global food shortages and 98% of coral bleached which means the oceans are fucked and a lot of fish are gone), but 3Â°C means _billions_ die. Right now we're heading for 4Â°C so everyone needs to get on top of this.

For context, one return flight from London to New York is 1-2 tonnes, a meat-based diet is 2.6 tonnes, and driving a car for a year is around 2.6 tonnes as well. Then there's buying stuff like laptops and other electronics which produce almost as much CO2 as short haul flight. ðŸ˜¨ These averages may not apply to you, maybe you're doing better, or worse! A calculator you can get more accurate insight, to congratulate you or motivate you to sort things out.

Once you've got a calculator that works for you, check out our [Carbon Reduction](/carbon-reduction) section to keep trimming it down until you get to 2 tonnes, then 1, then... 0?! Whilst you're sorting out your footprint, help others sort out theirs, and check out our [Politics](/politics) section to scale your personal action to collective action, and get your place of work to implement carbon tracking with the goal of going carbon neutral, or go [carbon negative like Microsoft](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2020/01/16/microsoft-will-be-carbon-negative-by-2030/).
