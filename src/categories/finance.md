intro: Banking and investing doesn't have to be all oil and mining, some have principles, and are helping solve the worlds problems.

Often people think about climate action as something that costs money, but rarely do people talk about it making money.

> It’s a common misconception that investors have to give up financial returns to make a positive impact. A benchmark study published by Cambridge Associates found that impact investing can capitalise on long-term social or environmental trends to compete with, and at times outperform, traditional asset class strategies. -- [EQ Investors](https://eqinvestors.co.uk/library/impact-investing-faqs/)

Before the COVID-19 financial slump, articles were being written about a growing class of billionares [getting rich in green tech](https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2020-green-billionaires/)), and major players in the investment space like were bailing on coal producers.

> BlackRock is an investment giant, with \$7.4 trillion of assets under management, so Fink’s call to arms last week marks a significant move. Cutting off funds for coal producers and driving up their cost of capital is key to suffocating a sector that is the single largest cause of increased global temperatures.

This is not even for altruistic reasons, they see it as a sound financial choice.

> BlackRock’s strategic shift is also driven by self-interest. That’s encouraging, as such initiatives tend to outlast moral outrage. Heat from activists, like the BlackRock’s Big Problem campaign, helped, but Fink argues he is making sustainability the new standard because it makes financial sense. The surge of inflows into the firm’s environmentally friendly funds last week will encourage that view. -- [Bloomberg.com](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-01-20/blackrock-climate-policy-can-do-more-to-reduce-coal-use-in-asia?srnd=green)

The fund managers at BlackRock might see it as financially sensible based on the changes coming, but others are using their money to make the change come sooner. Fund managers like Chris Hohn are using their capital to [bully companies into going green](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-01-22/the-world-s-most-profitable-hedge-fund-is-now-a-climate-radical), and despite major banks [pouring \$1.9 _trillion_ into fossil fuels in 2019 alone](https://www.ran.org/bankingonclimatechange2019/#data-panel), some banks are [divesting from coal](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/nov/15/european-investment-bank-to-phase-out-fossil-fuels-financing) due to protests and boycott's.

For better or worse, the climate crisis and money are intrinsically linked, and with the worlds major banks betting the house on oil, mining, and other destructive industries which keep needing bailouts, I'd rather take that money out of their hands, and give it to people who are also betting on the planet.
