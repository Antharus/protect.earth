  TomatoInk is an eco-friendly, low-cost provider of ink and toner. By packaging
  ink in remanufactured cartridges, we pass along substantial savings both
  financial and environmental to you. “Our factory collects high-quality used
  cartridges. There, they are professionally cleaned and inspected and any
  defective parts get replaced. The cartridges then get filled with high-quality
  ink comparable to that used in name-brand cartridges. And finally, every
  single cartridge is inspected and test printed.”
