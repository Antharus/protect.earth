  The emissions of a typical shower equal 3.5 – 7 km of driving. The mist
  shower, a satisfying but forgotten technology which uses very little water and
  energy, could be a solution. You can DIY convert almost any shower into a mist
  shower. The five-nozzle mist shower offers significant water and energy
  savings compared to a “normal” shower and does so without sacrificing comfort.
