  The Biggest Little Farm chronicles the eight-year quest of John and Molly
  Chester as they trade city living for 200 acres of barren farmland and a dream
  to harvest in harmony with nature. Through dogged perseverance and embracing
  the opportunity provided by nature's conflicts, the Chesters unlock and
  uncover a biodiverse design for living that exists far beyond their farm, its
  seasons, and our wildest imagination. Featuring breathtaking cinematography,
  captivating animals, and an urgent message to heed Mother Nature's call, The
  Biggest Little Farm provides us all a vital blueprint for better living and a
  healthier planet.
