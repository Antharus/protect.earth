  "City-proof" bikes, with electric assist, which ship fully assembled. They're
  baked full of anti-theft tech, and they'll hunt your bike down if it does get
  stolen. In some countries there is a subscription service where they'll fix
  things up for you if you have any trouble, but just the base bike alone is a
  stunning beautiful electric bike with dynamo hubs, built in lights, and
  sturdy mudguards, so you can ride it all day and night.
