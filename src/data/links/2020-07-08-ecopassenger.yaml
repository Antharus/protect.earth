  More than a quarter of worldwide greenhouse gases emissions come from the
  transportation sector, and more important, it is the sector where we have seen
  the highest growth in these emissions the last decades and it is not stopping.
  To help, EcoPassenger is a calculator to compare the energy consumption, CO2
  and exhaust atmospheric emissions for planes, cars, and trains, for passenger
  transport.
