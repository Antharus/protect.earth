  "Pre-mixed" cleaning sprays that you will find in the supermarket are over 90%
  water, with the active ingredient (the part that actually does the cleaning)
  making up a fraction of the total liquid. Oceansaver provide just the active
  ingredients, so people can reuse plastic bottles, reducing the consumption
  of single-use plastic.
