  Find out if you could save money switching to solar panels. This Google
  project uses Google Earth imagery to analyze your roof shape and local weather
  patterns to create a personalized solar plan. Adjust your electric bill to
  fine-tune your savings estimate and the recommended number of solar panels for
  your home, then compare loan, lease, and purchase options for your solar
  panels based on your results.
