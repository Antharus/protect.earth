  We facilitate the sustainable redistribution of healthy food that would
  otherwise be wasted to low-income communities, by bicycle. We work with
  communities to facilitate their own food redistribution and create
  decentralized systems to bypass barriers to food access. Our work envisions a
  world in which everyone has equitable access to healthy food.
