  Climeworks Direct Air Capture technology captures CO₂ from air, mixes
  the CO₂ with water used by a geothermal energy plant, then pumps it deep
  underground. Through natural processes, the CO₂ reacts with the basaltic rock
  – and turns into stone within a few years, permanently and safely. Iceland is
  one of several locations around the world that provide ideal conditions for
  our pioneering process. Subscribe monthly to offset a little bit of your footprint,
  and support the growth of this early stage technology.
