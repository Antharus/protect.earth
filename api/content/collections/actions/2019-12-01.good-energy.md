description: 'One of the few energy suppliers in the UK to generate renewable power from their own wind and solar farms, and buy renewable power from small independent renewable generators. From local farmers and community energy schemes to sustainable businesses that generate their own power and sell them the excess. A true renewable supplier, not just coal power + offset credits.'
