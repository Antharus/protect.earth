description: |
  Electric cars are still priced beyond the reach of many, but swapping a car for an electric motorbike will leave plenty of cash in your pocket. The average used car sells for $20,840 in the USA, and you can get a lot of electric motorbike for $3,000. Finding a used electric motorbike will get that manufactoring footprint off your conscience too.
