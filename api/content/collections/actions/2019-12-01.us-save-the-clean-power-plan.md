description: 'Fossil-fueled power plants are responsible for nearly 40 percent of Americaâ€™s carbon footprint. The Clean Power Plan calls for setting limits on this climate-warming pollution from these power plants, specifically at least 32 percent by 2030, compared to 2005 levels. By 2030, the Clean Power Plan could save the United States $20 billion in climate-related costs and deliver up to $34 billion in health benefits.'
