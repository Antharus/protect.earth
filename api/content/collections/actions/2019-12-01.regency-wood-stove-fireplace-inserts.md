description: 'If solar heating is not an option, wood stove inserts can update your drafty, open wood fireplace. They''ll send less heat out the chimney, and more heat around your house, drastically improving your wood burning efficiency. They pump the smoke back into the fire to burn that off too, which sends less crap into the atmosphere. Try to use [coffee logs](https://www.bio-bean.com/elements/coffee-logs-and-retailers/) instead of wood.'
