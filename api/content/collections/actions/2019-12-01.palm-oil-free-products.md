description: 'Make sure your makeup, biofuel, popcorn, candy, and other [various products](https://www.ethicalconsumer.org/palm-oil/palm-oil-free-list) are palm-oil free. The World Wildlife Fund estimates that 48 football fields worth of rainforest are cut down every minute! Itâ€™s estimated that palm oil plantations now cover around 27 million hectares. The forests being clear cut are often habitat for orangutans, who will be completely gone within 5-10 years at this rate.'
