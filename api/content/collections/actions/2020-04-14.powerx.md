description: 'A plug-and-play smart-controller for water and gas headers. It learns what water temperatures you like and heats only as much water as you need. It will also detect the ideal time to heat your water, as prices change every 15 minutes, so you can save money with no impact on hot water levels. Save hundreds of dollars, reduce carbon emissions equivalent to 10 fully grown trees â€“ every year!'
