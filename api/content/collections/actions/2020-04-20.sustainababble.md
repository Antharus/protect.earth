description: 'A weekly podcast about the environment, for and by the confused. Your hosts Ol and Dave are supposed to be experts in how to save the planet. But whyâ€™s everything got to be so confusing? Each week they try to get a little bit closer to enlightenment. They may fail. They sift through the most egregious eco-guff out there, exposing the real eco-villians vs the hapless incompetents.'
