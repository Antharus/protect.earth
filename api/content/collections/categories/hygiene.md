All around the world people handle things like using toilets, cleaning themselves, and baby diapers really differently. Western countries do everything in the least inefficient, least hygienic, and most expensive way. The average American uses 148 rolls of toilet paper a person, per year. That's 28 pounds of waste _just_ on toilet paper, but 70% of the world uses water - and that's been proven to be far more hygeinic. If you got poop on your hand, would you wash it off with water, or wipe it off with a bit of paper? ðŸ¤”

Our unhygienic inefficient ways have come about through marketing campaigns telling us they're better, but we've just been sold expensive, inefficient, unsustainable nonsense for years and now we're used to it. Let's look at some environmentally friendly alternatives which are just as good as what you're probably already doing, possibly cheaper, and possibly even _more_ hygienic.
