Personal cars and trucks account for [nearly one-quater of all U.S. greenhouse gas emissions](https://www.ucsusa.org/clean-vehicles/car-emissions-and-global-warming). Visit the EPA website for important information about SUVs and light trucks.

Despite the UK having [more electric charging points than petrol stations](https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/now-more-electric-vehicle-charging-18934596.amp), roughly half of drivers [say they need more charging points](https://www.statista.com/chart/17933/what-is-stopping-uk-drivers-from-buying-an-electric-car/), meaning only [6% of new cars being electric](https://www.statista.com/topics/2298/the-uk-electric-vehicle-industry/). Folks also seem to think that modern cars are more fuel efficient than older cars, but [petrol cars are getting less efficient every year](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/feb/28/new-cars-producing-more-carbon-dioxide-than-older-models).

There is no more time to wait. Hoping that everyone will maybe someday switch to electric cars is not any sort of solution for the world's problems, especially when so many countries still have coal and fossil fuels powering their grid. Lowering or [removing our reliance on personal cars](https://www.wired.com/story/germany-proves-cars-must-die/) will make a big difference. We need fewer cars, not just different cars.
